# IDLab: Powerful Personal Data

## Short description

To demonstrate how ‘taking back control of your personal data’ can really empower everyone in their daily lives, and how the imec technologies are a lever to create awesome web app demo(s) on top of personal data stores.&#x20;

## Project

Project template: [https://cloud.openknowledge.be/s/4KrRMSEJFrTtezF](https://cloud.openknowledge.be/s/4KrRMSEJFrTtezF)

_Your partner will give you a nice introduction as well on the first partner meeting!_

#### About the partner

**IDLab** is part of **imec**, the world-leading research and innovation hub in nano-electronics and digital technologies headquartered in Leuven. This innovation centre uses this knowledge to develop disruptive technologies and solutions in application areas such as health, smart cities and mobility, logistics and manufacturing, and energy.

IDLab "targets the most daunting challenges industry is facing to deliver digital transformation, connecting everything and extracting high value from data." ([source](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/idlab/)). It is a joint research initiative between  [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/ea/idlab/en), the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/idlab/), and imec.

Related to this project IDLab develops or sponsors technologies like comunica, rml.io for linked data generation and processing. The project aims to put these technologies to use.&#x20;
