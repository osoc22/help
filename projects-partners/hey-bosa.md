# BOSA & iO Digital 3: Hey BOSA

## Short Description \[in progress]

We would like to experiment and have a more clear view on the state of a voice assistant that can run locally and donâ€™t need an external service (so not like siri, google assistant but like [Jasper](https://jasperproject.github.io/) or [Rhasspy)](https://rhasspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)&#x20;
