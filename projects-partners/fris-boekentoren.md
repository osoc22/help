# EWI FRIS – UGent Library

## Short description

EWI – FRIS and Ghent University Library Boekentoren want to leverage the current available metadata from the research publications. We want to explore that metadata, combined and/or enriched with other data sources that are delivering added value to researchers. We will use this to motivate and inspire researchers to keep sharing their publications in a durable, qualitative and sustainable way.
