# BOSA & iO Digital 2: Inspector Widget

## Short description \[in progress]

We will make sure that fraude during sales periods won't happen anymore!

We want to help FOD Economie inspectors make sure that prices advertised online are correct based on rules and regulations.&#x20;

This project will help citizens (by blocking false advertising) and help civil servants (by outsourcing repetitive tasks to a program).
