# Communications & Branding

## Short Description

Make osoc and its partners âœ¨ _shin_e âœ¨ ! \
__Show potential future students, partners and coaches why they should participate in open summer of code.\
\
What the comms team is responsible for? ðŸ’ª\
You'll be doing internal communications, write project Highlights, take photos of all the teams and students, make buzz towards the outside world during #osoc22 (social media, blog, videos, photos), do the promo for the demo day. \
In addition to this, you are encouraged to rethink and set up a new branding strategy for open summer of code 2023 and think of new ways to promote osoc to participants (students, coaches, partners, sponsors) next year.
