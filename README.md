## **Be there on Monday at 09:00 **_**sharp**_

We will welcome you at the front door of the [WTC III building](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/3964305614#map=19/50.86078/4.35616) between 08:30 and 09:00 on Monday 4 July. At 9:00 _sharp_ we‚Äôll start with our opening presentation.

The first day is mainly an introduction day to get to know your teammates, coach, project and other teams. Many of you are new to open summer of code and that makes it super exciting!

Look at the [**calendar**](calendar-for-osoc22-belgium/) to discover what we'll be doing in the coming weeks.\


### What do I do when I'm ill?

**Stay home.** It happens to the best of us. First of all, inform your coach(es). The coach will make sure the word is out and. Once you've recovered, **please send a sick note to** [**info@osoc.be**](mailto:info@osoc.be).

#### COVID-19 regulations

If you test positive for COVID-19, follow Belgian regulations (7 days of quarantine).

At time of writing, they allow gatherings, but still encourage working from home. You are not required to wear a mask, but it is recommended when it gets crowded. We will make sure the offices are ventilated.

This is why we have a _blended_ edition, where we see each other on important moments but work from home whenever we can. If you're in quarantine but not ill, we make sure you can follow along from home.

## **Invite Your Friends to the Demo Day**

**Tell your friends and family to block their agenda on Thursday 28 July (13:00 to 16:00).**

On the last day of #osoc22, we‚Äôre going to present our projects to the general public! Our Demo Day will take in [Herman Teirlinck Building](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/444059131) and online via live streaming. Everyone is welcome!
