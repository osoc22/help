## **Be there on Monday 09:00 **_**sharp**_

We'd like to ask you to be online (on Discord) between 08:30 and 09:00 on Monday 5 July. At 9:00 _sharp_ we‚Äôll start with our opening presentation.

The first day is mainly an introduction day to get to know your teammates, coach, project and other teams. Many of you are new to open summer of code and that makes it super exciting.

Look at the [**calendar**](calendar-for-osoc21-belgium/) to discover what we'll be doing in the next days.
