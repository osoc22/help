**Thor Galle \[th0rgall#5081 on Discord]**\
_**Procedure Builder & Powerful Personal Data**_\
Owner at BitHarmony Oy

**Bio**

I'm Thor, a full-stack developer with some UX design chops! I studied Informatica at KU Leuven and "Human-Computer Interaction & Design" at EIT in Helsinki & Stockholm, graduating in 2020.

I joined my first oSoc edition in 2017 as a bachelor student, after that I continued helping coach Fredrik Vincx with his oSoc project in a fourth bachelor year 😏 (that project now evolved into [https://soulcenter.be/](https://soulcenter.be/)).

These experiences motivated me to work more with entrepreneurship, and ~~after~~ **while** finishing my studies I worked at a "digital sales" consultancy ([https://columbiaroad.com/](https://columbiaroad.com/)), a reading app startup ([https://readup.com](https://readup.com)) and a habit-tracker app startup ([https://potential.app](https://potential.app)).

I mostly do front-end web development, but in start-ups you end up doing almost everything ;) I have decent experience with Flutter as well.

The name "Thor" is misleading: I'm actually Belgian. Here's a full bio: [https://thorgalle.me/about](https://thorgalle.me/about)\

****Front-end > back-end > project mgmt - UX Design > UI Design > Business modelling JavaScript, TypeScript, node.js; React, Vue.js; Dart & Flutter.

Some PostgreSQL, some Python, some Bash, some Docker.

VSCode :) Contentful/HubSpot/Heroku/. . . . .&#x20;

**Good to know**\
On August 1st, 2018, _right_ after oSoc18, I took my bike and cycled \~2500km to Helsinki, where I studied and where I'm still living today (except for coming back to Belgium for oSoc22).
