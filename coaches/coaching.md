Friends and colleagues describe me as an enthusiastic, reliable and creative go-getter. I am interested in an infinite range of things, so you could see me planning a road trip one day and taking a painting class the next. I'm an advocate for gender equality and human rights, and I strongly believe in the power of digitalisation and open source! I have experience in business development, coaching, project management and qualitative research. You can also consider me your go-to person for team-building activities! 🕺\
