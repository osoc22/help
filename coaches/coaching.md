Friends and colleagues describe me as an enthusiastic, reliable and creative go-getter.

I'm an advocate for gender equality and human rights, and I strongly believe in the power of digitalisation and open source! I have experience in business development, coaching, project management and qualitative research. You can also consider me your go-to person for team-building activities! üï∫\

**Christophe Leroy \[Kyng#1717 on Discord]**\
****_**Procedure builder, coach coach & Butterfly**_\
frontend developer or frontend engineer I never know depends which paper you check at rock.estate

**Bio**\
You can call me Chris, Kyng or Batteman. But the important thing is you can call on me. I'll always figure out a way to help you.\
\
I love coaching at osoc, because it gets me out of my daily routine. It takes me back to where my front-end career started as a student developer in 2015.\
\
You can also ask me non-front-end related questions about good music, anime, coaching and life advice when I'm not taking care of my dog Snacky. Stay hydrated.

****Had a burnout simmering for a few months before osoc last year. It took me one week back at the job before it happened for real and had me quit relatively soon after that.
