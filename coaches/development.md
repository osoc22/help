**Thor Galle \[th0rgall#5081 on Discord]**\
_**Procedure Builder & Powerful Personal Data**_\
Owner at BitHarmony Oy

**Bio**

I'm Thor, a full-stack developer with some UX design chops! I studied Informatica at KU Leuven and "Human-Computer Interaction & Design" at EIT in Helsinki & Stockholm, graduating in 2020.

I joined my first oSoc edition in 2017 as a bachelor student, after that I continued helping coach Fredrik Vincx with his oSoc project in a fourth bachelor year 😏 (that project now evolved into [https://soulcenter.be/](https://soulcenter.be/)).

These experiences motivated me to work more with entrepreneurship, and ~~after~~ **while** finishing my studies I worked at a "digital sales" consultancy ([https://columbiaroad.com/](https://columbiaroad.com/)), a reading app startup ([https://readup.com](https://readup.com)) and a habit-tracker app startup ([https://potential.app](https://potential.app)).

I mostly do front-end web development, but in start-ups you end up doing almost everything ;) I have decent experience with Flutter as well.

The name "Thor" is misleading: I'm actually Belgian. Here's a full bio: [https://thorgalle.me/about](https://thorgalle.me/about)\

**Good to know**\
On August 1st, 2018, _right_ after oSoc18, I took my bike and cycled \~2500km to Helsinki, where I studied and where I'm still living today (except for coming back to Belgium for oSoc22).

You can call me Chris, Kyng or Batteman. But the important thing is you can call on me. I'll always figure out a way to help you.\

I love coaching at osoc, because it gets me out of my daily routine. It takes me back to where my front-end career started as a student developer in 2015.\

You can also ask me non-front-end related questions about good music, anime, coaching and life advice when I'm not taking care of my dog Snacky. Stay hydrated.
