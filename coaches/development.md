****I'm an IT consultant with a wide range of interests and experiences.

I graduated in Applied Computer Science at HoGent, where I not only discovered my interest for technology but also for people and business.

The world is constantly changing and transforming, because of this I'm often improving my knowledge of certain technologies, frameworks, workflows or anything that can help support organizations in delivering products and services in a more efficient way.\
