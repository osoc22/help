### Watching the pitches

Now is the team to discover what all teams have been up to this week, and what they all built! Give your colleagues some constructive feedback so they can do better next week.

Tell us about the pitch:

* What did you like?
* What could they do better?

About the project:

* Share tips and tricks, if you have any!

And don't forget to give everyone a wild applause 👏🦁👏🦁👏🦁👏

Be nice _or else._ We're here to support each other to do a better job. No need to mean or 💩 on people's parade – constructive feedback and highlighting wins is \*everything\*.

## Say Cheese!

We'll make a **picture** of _each team member_ + **a team picture** with _students and coaches_

_Make sure you wear your osoc shirt – you'll get it on arrival 🌈_

## Show us what your team is about.

We'll start sharing what your team has been working on, on the osoc site – the world deserves to know about the cool stuff you've been building!

* Share your project name in the [excel sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kYlOkmtwzf7le9x\_HVQ8tdbAn6gg2xG2tNKE-qMEm-Q/edit?usp=sharing).
* Summarise your project (± 200 characters) and put it in the [excel sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kYlOkmtwzf7le9x\_HVQ8tdbAn6gg2xG2tNKE-qMEm-Q/edit?usp=sharing) (you can base yourselves on your pitch).

### **\[Deadline] Create a crest**

Create a **crest** together \[[**Find out how**](https://help.osoc.be/global/how-to-create-crests)]. This crest represents your project and your team!

Share the crest in the [**crests**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11O6Qzy3T\_wn9rBI8jF2rCqluWarcgs\_v?usp=sharing) folder, name it after your project name, like so: _project-name-crest._

## Prep for next week

You have all afternoon to prep for next week. This could include:

* Go over the learnings you got from other teams about your pitch
* Reevaluate the way you worked together on this hackathon, what could you improve?
* Decide together what you'd like to build, with a [**brainstorm**](https://help.osoc.be/global/coaches/the-coaching-job/how-to-manage-a-team#3-brainstorm-ideas-2-bonus-adaptions) or a [**scoping session**](https://help.osoc.be/global/coaches/the-coaching-job/how-to-manage-a-team#how-to-do-a-scoping-session) for example. Keep in mind... _If you build something, but nobody know how to use it, does it even exist?_
* Do a retro with the team; what did you like about working together with a team, what would you want to change?

_Find your groove. Use this time to get ready to conquer the world... next week._

## _Optional After Work: Drinks! 🧃🥤🍺🍹_

_Gather at 17:00 at the entrance._

## OMG
