### \[optional talk] Equitable design, open data with Gulsen

In the digital age, data and technology act as a form of power, being used for good and for bad. As powerful as data is, however, it is not neutral and created and coded by humans. So there are many biases, assumptions and decisions that are built into it. If these go unquestioned, we are risking the echoing of inequities that already exist in society.

But what is your role as the creators of these technologies? What can you do to address these issues of power imbalances in your work? How can we create accountability mechanisms that go beyond the minimum legal requirements? In this talk, Gulsen Guler will introduce some basic concepts and tools that can help you take the first steps toward increasing equity in the tech field and work towards a world where we use technology for common good.\
