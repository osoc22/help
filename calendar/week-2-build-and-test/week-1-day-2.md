# Week 2 Day 1: First Build Week + Client Meetings + Talks

## Gooooood Morning

From now on your team will find its rhythm for the coming weeks. You'll find your groove with stand-ups (and -downs); client meetings, scoping sessions, retro's, pitches and all that good stuff. This rhythm is _nice_ to make sure you deliver quality projects in strong teams üí™

Build what you've defined last week. Go team!

## Client meetings

### How

Monday, the land of opportunity!

There's time in the morning to prepare your client meetings, if you didn't do that already the day before! Keep in mind:

* [ ] Show a _good_ demo. Practice this first. There's nothing more awkward than an unprepared demo.
* [ ] Check if you understood all needs and goals (you can reuse the pitch you made last week)
* [ ] List all the questions you have
* [ ] Decide who does the talking
* [ ] Decide who takes notes

Some tips and tricks can come in handy if you've never attended a client meeting before:

## Test What You Build

_If you build something, but nobody know how to use it, does it even exist?_
