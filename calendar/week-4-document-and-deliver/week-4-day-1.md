# Week 4 Day 1: Pitches + Invite People + Deliver like a Pro

Pitches\
– everyone
----------

### Watching the pitches

Let's help your colleagues do a stellar job during the demo day.

Tell us about the pitch:

* What did you like?
* What could they do better?

About the project:

* Share tips and tricks, if you have any!

And don't forget to give everyone a wild applause 👏🦁👏🦁👏🦁👏

{% hint style="warning" %}
Be nice _or else._ We're here to support each other to do a better job. No need to mean or 💩 on people's parade – constructive feedback and highlighting wins is \*everything\*.
{% endhint %}

## Invite People to the Demo Day!

Don't just invite your friends and family to show off what you made; invite your (future) colleagues and employers – so you get to land that dream job 😎

## Make Sure Your Project is Merged & Deployed

Today is the Final Call for Deployment Help. Ask Clément if you need it; Tuesday is his last day!
