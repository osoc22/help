## Partner meetings

### How

Mondays are always full of opportunities, and at osoc they present themselves as partner meetings.

To keep in mind for your first meeting:

* [ ] Present your team members (students and coaches)
* [ ] Check if you understood all needs and goals
* [ ] List all the questions you have
* [ ] Decide who does the talking
* [ ] Decide who takes notes

Some tips and tricks can come in handy if you've never attended a client meeting before:
