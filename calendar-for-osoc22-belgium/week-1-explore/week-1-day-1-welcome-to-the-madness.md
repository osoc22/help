Welcome to open summer of code! You'll get an introduction about what osoc is about, what [**Open Knowledge Belgium**](https://openknowledge.be/) is, how we work ([**code of conduct**](https://help.osoc.be/global/code-of-conduct) & [**how we work**](https://help.osoc.be/global/way-of-work)), what our 4 weeks will be about and what you'll be âœ¨[**delivering**](https://help.osoc.be/global/how-to-deliver-like-a-pro) âœ¨.

  * The sequence of pitches will be the one in the sheet.
  * The pitcher waits in the waiting room, and will be dragged into the pitching arena whenever they are up! Find out how here: [**https://help.osoc.be/global/pitching/hackathon-pitches**](https://help.osoc.be/global/pitching/hackathon-pitches)****
