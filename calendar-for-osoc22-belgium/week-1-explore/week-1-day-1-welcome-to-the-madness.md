**Introduction**\
**â€“ for everyone**
------------------

Welcome to open summer of code! You'll get an introduction about what osoc is about, what [**Open Knowledge Belgium**](https://openknowledge.be/) is, how we work ([**code of conduct**](https://help.osoc.be/global/code-of-conduct) & [**how we work**](https://help.osoc.be/global/way-of-work)), what our 4 weeks will be about and what you'll be âœ¨[**delivering**](https://help.osoc.be/global/how-to-deliver-like-a-pro) âœ¨.

**Get to know your team & your project** \
**â€“ team only**
---------------

### Whoâ€™s who & what do you do?

* Icebreaker; get to know each other!
* Share your skills, talents hobbies, â€¦

### What are we going to do?

* Study the briefing â€“ You can find the briefing in your [**project site**](../../projects-partners/projects-partners-overview.md)**.**
* Define the goal
*   Compose list of questions for partner/client

    _-> Compose it together in the folder of your team under meeting minutes_

## Partner meetings

### How

Mondays are always full of opportunities, and at osoc they present themselves as partner meetings.

There's time in the morning to prepare your partner meetings, if you didn't do that already the day before! To keep in mind for your first meeting:

* [ ] Present your team members (students and coaches)
* [ ] Check if you understood all needs and goals
* [ ] List all the questions you have
* [ ] Decide who does the talking
* [ ] Decide who takes notes

Some tips and tricks can come in handy if you've never attended a client meeting before:

## Say Cheese & Prep your Conversation Starter Profile

Send over **a picture** of _each team member_ + **take a screenshot** with _students and coaches_

* Make sure you wear your osoc shirt, and if you don't have it (yet), grab a colourful one ðŸŒˆ
* Add it in the **team picture folder**
  * Create a team folder in that folder for your team _team-name_
  * Name each picture _team-name-member-name-picture_,\
    and if it's a group pic _team-name-team-picture_

Because it's a remote edition, we set up a cool way to meet other people randomly â€“ with Conversation Starter (founded by a coach of ours, Rutger!)
