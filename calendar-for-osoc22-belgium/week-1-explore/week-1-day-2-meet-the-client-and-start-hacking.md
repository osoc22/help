# Week 1 Day 2: Start Hacking

## Partner meetings

### How

Mondays are always full of opportunities, and at osoc they present themselves as partner meetings.

There's time in the morning to prepare your partner meetings, if you didn't do that already the day before! To keep in mind for your first meeting:

* [ ] Present your team members (students and coaches)
* [ ] Check if you understood all needs and goals
* [ ] List all the questions you have
* [ ] Decide who does the talking
* [ ] Decide who takes notes

Some tips and tricks can come in handy if you've never attended a client meeting before:

## Hackathons

We do hackathons at the start of osoc to...

* _...really_ get to know each other. It's your time to shine, show what you can do and see how your other team members can bring a project to the next level âœ¨
* ...run through a first _cycle_ together; from defining what you're going to build, to building, to delivering a first valuable _thing_, which you will define during the scoping session.
* ...make mistakes. Please make a lot of mistakes and learn, to do better in the next cycle ðŸ”¥

### Examples

We want you to learn as much as possible from this hackathon, and it depends on the type of project you have what you're going to do.

* Refine the story; create a vision
* Create your wireframes/mockups
* A first prototype
* Try out a new technology
* Implement a first dataset
* ... Surprise us

### How

Not sure how to get started on this hackathon? Try a [**brainstorm**](https://help.osoc.be/global/coaches/the-coaching-job/how-to-manage-a-team#3-brainstorm-ideas-2-bonus-adaptions) to get the creative juices flowing, or do a [**scoping session**](https://help.osoc.be/global/coaches/the-coaching-job/how-to-manage-a-team#how-to-do-a-scoping-session) to narrow down what you're going to do. Take the time you need, the team decides when they are to start hacking!&#x20;

You're definitely free to do it _your way!_ As long as the team is working together.

Oh and remember the rule of **Ï€** ([pi](https://twitter.com/pietercolpaert))... When doing an estimation of a task, let's say, for an hour, it's most likely to take about 3.14 times longer. Thank us later.
