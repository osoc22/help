## Client meetings

### How

On Tuesdays we wear pink.. I mean meet clients.

There's time in the morning to prepare your client meetings, if you didn't do that already the day before! To keep in mind for your first meeting:

* [ ] Present your team members (students and coaches)
* [ ] Check if you understood all needs and goals (you can reuse the pitch you made on day 1)
* [ ] List all the questions you have
* [ ] Decide who does the talking
* [ ] Decide who takes notes

Some tips and tricks can come in handy if you've never attended a client meeting before:

## Hackathons

We do hackathons at the start of osoc to...

* _...really_ get to know each other. It's your time to shine, show what you can do and see how your other team members can bring a project to the next level âœ¨
* ...run through a first _cycle_ together; from defining what you're going to build, to building, to delivering a first valuable _thing_, which you will define during the scoping session.
* ...make mistakes. Please make a lot of mistakes and learn, to do better in the next cycle ðŸ”¥

### Examples

We want you to learn as much as possible from this hackathon, and it depends on the type of project you have what you're going to do.

* Refine the story; create a vision
* Create your wireframes/mockups
* A first prototype
* Try out a new technology
* Implement a first dataset
* ... Surprise us

### How

Not sure how to get started on this hackathon? Try a [**brainstorm**](https://help.osoc.be/global/coaches/the-coaching-job/how-to-manage-a-team#3-brainstorm-ideas-2-bonus-adaptions) to get the creative juices flowing, or do a [**scoping session**](https://help.osoc.be/global/coaches/the-coaching-job/how-to-manage-a-team#how-to-do-a-scoping-session) to narrow down what you're going to do. Take the time you need, the team decides when they are to start hacking!&#x20;

You're definitely free to do it _your way!_ As long as the team is working together.
