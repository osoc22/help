## Invite People to the Demo Day

Don't just invite your friends and family to show off what you made; invite your (future) colleagues and employers â€“ so you get to land that dream job ðŸ˜Ž.

## Client meetings

### How

Monday, the land of opportunity!

There's time in the morning to prepare your client meetings, if you didn't do that already the day before! Keep in mind:

* [ ] Show a _good_ demo. Practice this first. There's nothing more awkward than an unprepared demo.
* [ ] Check if you understood all needs and goals (you can reuse the pitch you made last week)
* [ ] List all the questions you have
* [ ] Decide who does the talking
* [ ] Decide who takes notes

Some tips and tricks can come in handy if you've never attended a client meeting before:
