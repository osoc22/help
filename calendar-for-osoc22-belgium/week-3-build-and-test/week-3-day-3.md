# Week 3 Day 3: Day Off ðŸ˜˜ + Invite People!

## Invite People to the Demo Day!

Don't just invite your friends and family to show off what you made; invite your (future) colleagues and employers â€“ so you get to land that dream job ðŸ˜Ž

## Prep for next week

You have all afternoon to prep for next week. This could include:

* Go over the learnings you got from other teams about your pitch
* Reevaluate the way you worked together on this hackathon, what could you improve?
* Decide together what you'd like to build, with a [**brainstorm**](https://help.osoc.be/global/coaches/the-coaching-job/how-to-manage-a-team#3-brainstorm-ideas-2-bonus-adaptions) or a [**scoping session**](https://help.osoc.be/global/coaches/the-coaching-job/how-to-manage-a-team#how-to-do-a-scoping-session) for example.
* Do a retro with the team; what did you like about working together with a team, what would you want to change?

_Find your groove. Use this time to get ready to conquer the world... next week._
