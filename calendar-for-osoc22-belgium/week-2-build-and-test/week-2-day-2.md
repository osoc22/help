# Week 2 Day 2: Client meetings

## Client meetings

### How

On Tuesdays we wear pink.. I mean meet clients.

There's time in the morning to prepare your client meetings, if you didn't do that already the day before! To keep in mind for your first meeting:

* [ ] Present your team members (students and coaches)
* [ ] Check if you understood all needs and goals (you can reuse the pitch you made on day 1)
* [ ] List all the questions you have
* [ ] Decide who does the talking
* [ ] Decide who takes notes

Some tips and tricks can come in handy if you've never attended a client meeting before:

## Pick your Talk

### \[optional workshop 1] Collaborating between Design and Dev by Niels

Go to [**Workshops & Talks**](../../workshops-and-talks.md) and find this one and other interesting ones there!

### \[optional workshop 2] Data Prototyping in Notion by Thor

Thor, an osoc alumni that has made some _niiiiice_ projects with us has a very low-entry way of prototyping data in Notion. It'll help your team think about what they need (what data, database structure, ...) _before_ they start building things for human beings. &#x20;
