# Week 2 Day 1: First Build Week + Client Meetings + Talks

## Gooooood Morning

From now on your team will find its rhythm for the coming weeks. You'll find your groove with stand-ups (and -downs); client meetings, scoping sessions, retro's, pitches and all that good stuff. This rhythm is _nice_ to make sure you deliver quality projects in strong teams ðŸ’ª

Build what you've defined last week. Go team!

## Test What You Build

_If you build something, but nobody know how to use it, does it even exist?_

### \[optional workshop 1] Sexual harassment: why react and how? by Plan International NGO

Learn how to help others and yourself! When someone is being harassed, as a bystander you do not always know what to do. Not knowing how to respond or being afraid of getting into trouble yourself are normal reactions. However, any form of action or help can make a world of difference to the victim. Join this session if you want to learn more about this topic and how to intervene.

### \[optional workshop 2] Data Viz with Leenke

Got data? That's nice. Now how do you bring this in a comprehensive way to people out there? Leenke will tell you all about it!
