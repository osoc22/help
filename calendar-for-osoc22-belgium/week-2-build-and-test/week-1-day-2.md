# Week 2 Day 1: First Build Week + Talks

## Gooooood Morning

From now on your team will find its rhythm for the coming weeks. You'll find your groove with stand-ups (and -downs); client meetings, scoping sessions, retro's, pitches and all that good stuff. This rhythm is _nice_ to make sure you deliver quality projects in strong teams ðŸ’ª

Build what you've defined last week. Go team!

## Test What You Build

_If you build something, but nobody know how to use it, does it even exist?_

How to conduct user interviews and tests: [**Conduct (Remote) Tests and Interviews with Real People**](https://help.osoc.be/global/tutorials/how-to-conduct-remote-tests-and-interviews-with-real-people)****

## Pick Your Talk

We've got 2 talks for you in store today! You can watch them later as well, we'll share them in the #announcements channel ðŸ¥³

### \[optional workshop 1] Data Docker by Selwin Konijn

Is Docker still a mystery for you? Say no more! Jodi recommended Selwin's talk because apparently it's _very_ comprehensive. Please install Docker Desktop and have an ide / text editor availabe (like visual studio). Meeting link in [**calendar**](week-1-day-2.md).

### \[optional workshop 2] How to Start a Startup by Rutger

Rutger founded Conversation Starter a while ago; and he'll reveal how he did it! He's also been a coach with osoc several times; doing a stellar job. Meeting link in [**calendar**](week-1-day-2.md).
