{% endhint %}

## Pick Your Talk

We've got 2 talks for you in store today! You can watch them later as well, we'll share them in the #announcements channel ðŸ¥³

### \[optional workshop 1] Data Docker by Selwin Konijn

Is Docker still a mystery for you? Say no more! Jodi recommended Selwin's talk because apparently it's _very_ comprehensive. Please install Docker Desktop and have an ide / text editor availabe (like visual studio). Meeting link in [**calendar**](week-1-day-2.md).

### \[optional workshop 2] Deployment support by ClÃ©ment

Open summer of code provides support with deployment. We'll discuss what we can and cannot do. If you're going to deploy something, make sure one of your team members is going to attend! Meeting link in [**calendar**](week-1-day-2.md).
