## Prep for next week

You have all afternoon to prep for next week. This could include:

* Go over the learnings you got from other teams about your pitch
* Reevaluate the way you worked together on this hackathon, what could you improve?
* Decide together what you'd like to build, with a [**brainstorm**](https://help.osoc.be/global/coaches/the-coaching-job/how-to-manage-a-team#3-brainstorm-ideas-2-bonus-adaptions) or a [**scoping session**](https://help.osoc.be/global/coaches/the-coaching-job/how-to-manage-a-team#how-to-do-a-scoping-session) for example.
* Do a retro with the team; what did you like about working together with a team, what would you want to change?

_Find your groove. Use this time to get ready to conquer the world... next week._

## Pitch Festival

Now is the team to discover what all teams have been up to this week, and what they all built! Give your colleagues some constructive feedback so they can do _even better_ next week.

* What did you like?
* What could they do better?

About the project:

* Share tips and tricks, if you have any!

And don't forget to give everyone a wild applause 👏🦁👏🦁👏🦁👏
