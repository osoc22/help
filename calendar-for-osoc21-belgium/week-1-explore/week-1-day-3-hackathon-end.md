## Continue Hackathon

Get those precious learnings ðŸ¦„ðŸ¦„ðŸ¦„ðŸ¦„

_Built something? Maybe you can already run the team's idea past someone or some more people, and already get some precious feedback!_

## Pitch Deadline at 15:30

Your second pitch of the week will be delivered in a video format.

Drop your video in the drive folder "[**Hackathon Pitches**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/176f9xH7aPqx5vSd8ELfPU3ZvZaEXzxeM?usp=sharing)" by 15:30. Not later! We still have to compile them for the pitch stream the second day! (Ping Miet if you're running into trouble).

## \[optional] Git workshop by Martin

After your hard work, you're welcome to join the Git workshop provided by Martin to feed your juicy brains ([**click the calendar**](week-1-day-3-hackathon-end.md#calendar) to find the meeting link!).
